raven: clojure sentry client library
====================================

A Clojure library to send events to a sentry host.


### Usage

```clojure
[[spootnik/raven "0.1.4"]]
```

The main exported function is `capture!` and has two arities:

- `(capture! dsn event)`: Send a capture over the network, see the description of DSN and ev below.
- `(capture! context dsn event)`: Send a capture passing additional context, such as a specific HTTP client.

#### Arguments

- **DSN**: A Sentry DSN as defined http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/2.9.0/client/index.html#parsing-the-dsn
- **Event**: Either an exception or a map.
- **Context**: A map of additional information you can pass to Sentry. Note
  that omitting this parameter will make use of some thread-local storage for
  some of the functionality.

#### Passing your own http instance

In many cases, it makes sense to reuse an already existing http client (created
with http/build-client). Raven will reuse an http instance if it is passed to
the (capture!) function through the `context` parameter, as :http.

```clojure
(capture! {:http (http/build-client {})} "<dsn>" "My message")
```

### Extra interfaces

#### Breadcrumbs

Adding sentry "breadcrumbs" can be done using the `add-breadcrumb!` function,
that has the following arities:

- `(add-breadcrumb! breadcrumb)` Store a breadcrumb in thread-local storage.
- `(add-breadcrumb! context breadcrumb)` Store a breadcrumb in a user-specified
context. Context is expected to be map-like.

Well-formatted breadcrumb maps can be created with the `make-breadcrumb!`
helper, with the following arities:

- `(make-breadcrumb! message category)` A breadcrumb will be created with the
  "info" level.
- `(make-breadcrumb! message category level)` This allows specifying a level.
  Levels can be one of: 'debug' 'info' 'warning' 'warn' 'error' 'exception' 'critical' 'fatal'
- `(make-breadcrumb! message category level timestamp)` This allows setting a
  custom timestamp instead of letting the helper get one for you. Timestamp
  must be a floating point representation of **seconds** elapsed since the
  epoch (not milliseconds).

More information can be found on [Sentry's documentation website](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/interfaces/breadcrumbs/)

#### User

Sentry supports adding information about the user when capturing events. This
library makes it possible using the `add-user!` function, with the following
arities:

- `(add-user! user)` Store a user in thread-local storage.
- `(add-user! context user)` Store a user in a user-specified context. Context
  is expected to be map-like.

Well-formatted user maps can be created with the `make-user` helper function,
with the following arities:

- `(make-user id)` A simple user map with the only required field (the user's
  id) is created.
- `(make-user id email ip-address username)` A map with all "special"
  fields recognised by sentry is created. Additional fields can be added to the
  created user map if desired, and will simply show up in the interface as
  extra fields.

More information can be found on [Sentry's documentation website](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/interfaces/user/)

#### HTTP Requests

As for Users, Sentry supports adding information about the HTTP request that
resulted in the captured exception. To fill in that information this library
provides a `add-http-info!` function with the following arities:

- `(add-http-info! info)` Store the HTTP information in thread-local storage.
- `(add-http-info! context info)` Store the HTTP information in the
user-specified map-like context (expected to be ultimately passed to `(capture!)`).

Well formatted HTTP information maps can be created with the `make-http-info`
helper function, with the following arities:

- `(make-http-info url method)` A simple HTTP info map with only required
  fields (the request's URL and method) is created.
- `(make-http-info url method headers query_string cookies data env)` Creates a
  map with all the "special" fields recognised by Sentry. Additional fields can
  be added to the created HTTP map if desired, and will simply show up in the
  interface as extra fields.

More information about the HTTP interface can be found on [Sentry's
documentation website](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/interfaces/http/).

#### Fingerprints

In cases where you do not send an exception, Sentry will try to group your
message by looking at differences in interfaces. In some cases, this is not
enough, and you will want to specify a particular grouping fingerprint, [as
explained in this part of the Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/rollups/#custom-grouping).

To set a custom fingerprint for a particular event, this library provides the
`add-fingerprint!` function with the following arities:

- `(add-fingerprint! fingerprint)` Store the fingerprint in thread-local
  storage.
- `(add-fingerprint! context fingerprint)` Store the fingerprint in the
  user-specified map-like context (expected to be passed to `capture!`).

The contents of the :fingerprint entry is expected to be a list of strings.

#### Full example

The following examples send Sentry a payload with all extra interfaces provided
by this library.

```clojure
(def dsn "https://098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6:ad0234829205b9033196ba818f7a872b@sentry.example.com/42")
(add-breadcrumb! (make-breadcrumb! "The user did something" "com.example.Foo"))
(add-breadcrumb! (make-breadcrumb! "The user did something wrong" "com.example.Foo" "error"))
(add-user! (make-user "user-id" "test@example.com" "127.0.0.1" "username"))
(add-http-info! (make-http-info "http://example.com/mypage" "GET"))
(capture! dsn (Exception.))
```

### Testing

#### Unit tests

As usual in the clojure world, a simple `lein test` should run unit tests.

#### Integration tests

To ensure the results are correctly handled by Sentry and that this library
produces correct JSON payloads, a simple integration test can be run with

```bash
DSN=http://... lein test :integration
```

This will publish a test event in the project associated with the DSN with as
much test data as possible.
